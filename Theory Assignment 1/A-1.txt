1.  Every declaration is on the new line first in the code. 
    Even variables declared on the same line are written on the different lines. 
    Temporary variables are also declared at first. 
    Global variable Z is declared as Z.0 in main() function.

2.  Complex expressions are broken down into sub-expressions and assigned to the temporary variables in the order of precedence. 
    Temporary variables are introduced on every sub-expression.

3.  Float/Doubles are represented in scientific notation. 
    When float/double is assigned to an integer, '(int)' prefix is applied before float/double.

4.  Reads are performed by representing Z by Z.0 and writes as usual. 
    In the statement 'Z = Z + 1' there is one sub-expression 'Z + 1'. 
    The statement is executed in two steps, performing operation 'Z + 1' and assigning its value to Z, while 'q = Z' is only assignment operation. 
    Thats why, a temporary variable is introduced to perform two steps of 'Z = Z + 1' statement.
