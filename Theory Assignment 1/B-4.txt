1.  In original code, 'a + c' is computed twice whereas in FRE pass, the same is computed only once.

2.  FRE is optimized twice in the files .fre2 and .fre3.

3.  As we have mensioned integer as output, we have to return an integer. 
    Here we are returning integer b.
    If we replace b with 0 in return statement. It will not make any difference. Just 0 will replace b in the .fre1 file.
