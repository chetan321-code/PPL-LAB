1.  Yes, each usage of local variable as an operand uses a suffix.
    (D) suffix is used to indicate that variable c is not initialized.

2.  Syntax: (variable to be assigned) = PHI <(variable to assign in case-1), (variable to assign in case-2), . . .>

3.  int main() {
        int variables;

        if(condition) {
            variable = value;
        }
        else if(condition) {
            variable = value;
        }
        else {
            vairable = value;
        }
        return 0;
    }

    PHI will merge as many versions of the variables as many times they are assigned in different if-else conditions.
